# Week 3: Data Subsetting

## Objectives

Upon completion of this session, you will be able to do the following:
- Rename variables of a dataset
- Select observations and variables from a dataset
- Add new observations and variables to a dataset
- Reorder datasets

## Overview

After importing a dataset into R, the first steps in data cleaning and analysis often involving subsetting a dataset based on values of the data. Here we will primarly cover how to do these tasks using the syntax of `dplyr`, a new and often times easier to understand framework for data manipulation.

### Brief Overview: Read and work through the [introduction to the `dplyr` package](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html)
 
### A. Using `dplyr` to subset datasets

Read and work through the R for Data Science "Data Transformation" subsections:
- [Rows](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#filter-rows-with-filter)
- [Columns](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#select-columns-with-select)
	
### B. Using `dplyr` to arrange datasets

Read and work through Data Transformation subsections:
- [Rows](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#arrange-rows-with-arrange)

### C. Using `dplyr` to add new variables

Read and work through Data Transformation subsections:
- [Columns](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#add-new-variables-with-mutate)

Lab: Work through [this lab](http://sisbid.github.io/Module1/labs/subsetting-data-lab.Rmd) on data subsetting. The key is available [here](http://sisbid.github.io/Module1/labs/subsetting-data-lab-key.Rmd)
