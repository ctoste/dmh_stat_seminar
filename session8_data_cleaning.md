### Data Cleaning

In general, data cleaning is a process of investigating your data for inaccuracies, or recoding it in a way that makes it more manageable.

[This lecture](http://aejaffe.com/winterR_2017/Data_Cleaning/lecture/Data_Cleaning.html) from myself and John Muschelli covers some basics ([PDF](http://aejaffe.com/winterR_2017/Data_Cleaning/lecture/Data_Cleaning.pdf))

R for Data Science has some additional resources on wrangling [Strings](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html), [Factors](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html), and [Dates](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html) (although we covered this a bit before)
