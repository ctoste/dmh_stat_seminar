# Week 2: Data Import in R

## Objectives

Upon completion of this session, you will be able to do the following:
- Get R up and running
- Import text files
- Import Excel files

## Overview

### A. Get R up and running

- Download R: https://cran.r-project.org/ . The most recent version is 3.4.1 (as of 8/28)
- Download RStudio Desktop: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download . The most recent version is 1.0.153 (as of 8/28)

RStudio is a useful integrated development environment (IDE) for R that makes the language easier to learn. It is recommended for newcomers, but also has pretty powerful functionality for expert users, particularly package developers. 

View these slides on an [introduction to RStudio](http://aejaffe.com/winterR_2017/RStudio/lecture/RStudio.html) - [PDF](http://aejaffe.com/winterR_2017/RStudio/lecture/RStudio.pdf) - from my and John Muschell's winter institute class: 
This ["cheat sheet"](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf) contains many useful commands, shortcuts, and descriptions

These two resources teach the basics of R, and working through both is highly recommended:

- [Try R on Code School](http://tryr.codeschool.com/) 
- [Introduction to R on Data Camp](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)

### B. Data Import in R

- View these slides on [data import in R](http://aejaffe.com/winterR_2017/Data_IO/lecture/Data_IO.html) - [PDF](http://aejaffe.com/winterR_2017/Data_IO/lecture/Data_IO.pdf) my and John Muschelli's class. Try to work along side the lecture notes in your own R session. 
- Try this [lab on data import in R](http://sisbid.github.io/Module1/labs/data-io-lab.Rmd) from my and Jeff Leek's summer class at UW
- Bonus: Commit and push code from working alongside the lecture and doing the lab into your GitHub repository for the class

The key for the lab is [here](http://sisbid.github.io/Module1/labs/data-io-lab-key.Rmd).
